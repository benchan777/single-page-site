                    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                    <p>Rachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. At a young age, she was
                        already an avid reader and she began writing her own stories at eight years old. At ten years
                        old, she already had her first story published. Throughout her teenage years, she was influenced
                        by her mother's life long love of nature and the living world and grew to have her own interest
                        in novels about the natural world and the ocean. After graduating high school, Rachel attended
                        Pennsylvania College for Women known today as Chatham University and studied English. She later
                        switched her major to biology but continued to write for the student newspaper. She was later
                        accepted to Johns Hopkins University in 1928 for her graduate studies but was unable to attend
                        due to financial difficulties. She later took a summer course at the Marine Biological
                        Laboratory and continued her studies in zoology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University. She
                        ended up receiving her MA in zoology from the university in 1932.</p>

                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>After graduating college, Rachel was hired by the U.S Bureau of Fisheries to write radio scripts. She
                    was only the second woman to have been hired by the Bureau. Her main job was to analyze and report
                    data on fish populations. Her work allowed her to often visit Chesapeake Bay where she toured
                    commercial plants and conservation facilities. Carson published her first book , Under the Sea-Wind,
                    in 1941. There, she discovered her ability to present complex scientific topics clearly in a way
                    that captivated her readers. In 1943, Carson was promoted to an aquatic biologist in the U.S. Fish
                    and Wildlife Service where she wrote many articles that were meant for the American public. Series
                    such as “Food from the Sea” and “Conservation in Action” provided information on the health benefits
                    and how to properly prepare fish and shellfish. In 1952, she wrote her second book, The Sea Around
                    Us which was wildly successful. Translated into 32 languages, it was on the New York Times’ best
                    seller list for 81 weeks. Due to the success of the book, Carson resigned from the Fish and Wildlife
                    service to spend more time on writing. Her third book, The Edge of the Sea fostered the new
                    perspective of ecology which had not existed beforehand. However, it was her final book, Silent
                    Spring, that spurred concern for the true damage being done to the ecosystem by pesticides. She was
                    particularly concerned about the use of DDT which was introduced in 1945. Being a biologist, she was
                    able to see the early effects of DDT on fish and wildlife and was able to see the impending danger
                    DDt would have on the rest of the environment. With the help of a few others who also worked at the
                    Fish and Wildlife Service, Carson wrote Silent Spring and provided documentation on the effects of
                    DDT that were not well known by the public. The book sparked massive controversy and also personal
                    attacks on herself, especially from the pesticide industry trying to discredit her. However, their
                    efforts were in vain as the federal government ordered a review on how pesticides were used and
                    asked Carson to testify. As a result of this review, DDT was banned and along with that, there was
                    now more scrutiny into general concern for the environment. Silent Spring is credited to sparking
                    the environmental movement that eventually led to the creation of the Environmental Protection
                    Agency.</p>

                        exclusively, but can also harm people without direct exposure. Carson suggests that we need more
                        education and other more environmentally friendly ways to protect crops.</p>
