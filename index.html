                    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                    <p>Rachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. At a young age, she was
                        already an avid reader and she began writing her own stories at eight years old. At ten years
                        old, she already had her first story published. Throughout her teenage years, she was influenced
                        by her mother's life long love of nature and the living world and grew to have her own interest
                        in novels about the natural world and the ocean. After graduating high school, Rachel attended
                        Pennsylvania College for Women known today as Chatham University and studied English. She later
                        switched her major to biology but continued to write for the student newspaper. She was later
                        accepted to Johns Hopkins University in 1928 for her graduate studies but was unable to attend
                        due to financial difficulties. She later took a summer course at the Marine Biological
                        Laboratory and continued her studies in zoology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University. She
                        ended up receiving her MA in zoology from the university in 1932.</p>

                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>After graduating college, Rachel was hired by the U.S Bureau of Fisheries to write radio scripts. She
                    was only the second woman to have been hired by the Bureau. Her main job was to analyze and report
                    data on fish populations. Her work allowed her to often visit Chesapeake Bay where she toured commercial plants and conservation facilities </p>
